# Decentralized Gaming Platform

## Project Title
**Decentralized Gaming Platform**

## Project Description
The Decentralized Gaming Platform allows game developers to publish games and in-game assets while enabling players to purchase and own these assets using Lumens (XLM). Ownership of in-game assets is secured and enforced by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where developers can monetize their games directly, and players can own and trade their in-game assets with full control over ownership. The platform provides a seamless experience with trustless and transparent transactions powered by blockchain technology.

## Key Features
- **Publish In-Game Assets**: Developers can create and publish in-game assets that players can purchase.
- **Secure Ownership**: Players own their in-game assets through immutable records on the blockchain.
- **In-Game Purchases**: Players can purchase assets using Lumens (XLM), ensuring seamless and secure transactions.
- **Decentralized Control**: No central authorityâ€”game developers and players control their assets and transactions.
